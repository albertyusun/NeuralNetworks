# NeuralNetworks
Let's build and play around with some neural networks! The goal of this project is for me to understand the full stack, or low-level intuition, of neural networks. I hope to harness this understanding so I can better modify and create neural networks for deep learning in the future.

This project was inspired by [Andrew Ng's interview of Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_au3yw46lcg).
