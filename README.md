# Goal
Let's build and play around with some neural networks! The goal of this project is for me to understand the full stack, or low-level intuition, of neural networks. I hope to harness this understanding so that I can modify and create neural networks for deep learning. I plan on playing with deep learning frameworks such as tensorflow, keras, and pytorch sometime in the future as well.

This project was inspired by [Andrew Ng's interview of Tesla Engineer Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_au3yw46lcg). Karpathy noted the importance of understanding "what lies under the hood" in pre-existing neural network frameworks that exist today.
