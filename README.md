# Goal
Let's build and play around with some neural networks! The goal of this project is for me to understand the full stack, or low-level intuition, of neural networks. I hope to harness this understanding so that I can modify and create neural networks for deep learning. I plan on playing with deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch sometime in the future as well.

This project is inspired by [Andrew Ng's interview of Tesla Engineer Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_au3yw46lcg). Although many deep learning tools exist today, Karpathy emphasized the importance in "what lies under the hood" of these tools.
